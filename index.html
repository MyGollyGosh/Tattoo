        <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="paragraph-1">Welcome to my website! My work has a fine line, illustritative quality that is heavily influenced by the natural world and vintage imagery. Influenced by Beatrix Potter and anthropomorphism, I tattoo animals in a unique and endearing way, often giving them their own personality and home on the body. Applying techniques that uses fine lines for shading, my flora and fauna tattoos are unique and original. <br><br> Client oriented and considerate, I'm always happy to work around your ideas, answer any questions and offer support during the entire process. I specialise in custom designs delivering drawing and tattoos hat are exclusive to you. <br><br> To book please contact me through DM or email. I work Tuesday - Saturday at The Dollhouse in Brighton.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-2">This is a sentence about Iris going to Uni and learning cool stuff about art to be become a better arter. This is a sentence that adds to that a bit<br><br>
        This sentence is a personal testamony from someone saying how flippin cool Iris is and why their work should be respected. This will add to that and talk about some influences that people might know and will enjoy. Finally it'll all be brought together by a final statement about how everyone should check out Iris's work<br><br>
